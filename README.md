# Fish Market - Linear regression

Quick analysis using linear regression to predict the weight of fish, using r! Here, besides exposing some concepts, I plot some data visualizations and store functions which can be useful in the future.

This repo is the basis for my [blog post (in portuguese)](https://www.lucasmoraes.org/blog/fish_market/) regarding this analysis. Also, it can be cloned and run locally to generate the same Rmarkdown output.

Here I chose the best explanatory variables to predict fish weight. I also briefly explored some concepts such as:

-   Residuals

-   Coefficients

-   Cook's distance

-   Variance inflation index

As always, there is also some plotting going on :chart:
